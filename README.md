## Quick Start

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_token_here" python3 -m discord_py_self_mcp.main
```

> **IMPORTANT:** You must set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable before starting the MCP server.

Then connect via your MCP client (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) and all 34 Discord tools will be available.

### overview

discord-py-self-mcp acts as a bridge between your AI assistant (Claude Code, Opencode, Codex, etc.) and your personal Discord account. unlike standard bots, this "selfbot" runs as you; allowing your AI to read your DMs, reply to friends, manage your servers, and interact with buttons/menus just like a human user.

built on: [discord.py-self](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self) library by dolfies. it offers a safe, stable, and feature-rich interface for automating your daily discord life.

> **note**: automating user accounts is against the Discord ToS. use this at your own risk.
